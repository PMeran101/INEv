# INEv: INEv: In-Network Evaluation for Event Stream Processing

## Overview

This repository contains the queries and realworld data sets used in our case study, the implementation of algorithms for the construction of INEv graphs and DCEP-Ambrosia - a light-weight implementation for distributed complex event processing using Microsoft Ambrosia.


#### INEv

The directory `INEv` contains the implementation of our algorithms and the scripts used to conduct the experiments presented in the paper.

#### DCEP_Ambrosia

The directory `DCEP_Ambrosia` contains the implementation of distributed complex event processing using Microsoft Ambrosia. The query processor can alternatively be started as a simulation which does not require to locally set up Ambrosia.
The input files used to conduct our case study as well as input files for the evaluation of INEv graph based on synthetic data can be found in `DCEP_Ambrosia/inputdata` 

#### CaseStudy

The directory contains a descriptions of the queries used in our case study.
